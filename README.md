# Projects from Reinforcement Learning Research

First, I implemented the Thompson Sampling Algorithm in the Multi-Armed Bandit - Bernoulli Bandit Problem context. I used the graphs to create a video of the simulation of the algorithm in action. 

Second, I implemented the Thompson Sampling Algorithm with Normal Posterior Distributions in the Multi-Armed Bandit context. Equations for calculating the normal posterior distributions are in the Equations pdf. 

Third, I implemented the Epsilon Greedy Algorithm. 

All of these algorithms I developed were used for policy evaluation. The full report is found in the Confidence Intervals for Policy Evaluation in Adaptive Experiments Report.
